Modern societies depend on complex technological infrastructure such as software systems, networks, and critical services.

Failures in infrastructure systems can cascade across dependent components and services.

Automation improves efficiency but can increase systemic risk if failures are not well understood.

Resilience and fault tolerance are key design goals for critical infrastructure systems.

Monitoring, redundancy, and graceful degradation reduce the impact of system failures.

Human operators play a crucial role in managing unexpected scenarios and emergencies.

Technical debt and hidden dependencies increase long-term system fragility.
