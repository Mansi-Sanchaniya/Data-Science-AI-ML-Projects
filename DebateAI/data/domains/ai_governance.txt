AI governance focuses on ensuring that artificial intelligence systems are developed and deployed responsibly.

Key principles of AI governance include transparency, accountability, fairness, safety, and robustness.

Autonomous AI systems introduce risks related to loss of human control, unclear responsibility, and unintended consequences.

High-risk AI applications often require human-in-the-loop or human-on-the-loop oversight mechanisms.

Model limitations, data bias, and distribution shift are common failure modes in deployed AI systems.

Regulatory frameworks increasingly require explainability, auditability, and documentation of AI decisions.

Monitoring and post-deployment evaluation are essential to detect performance degradation and emerging risks.

Governance approaches balance innovation benefits against societal, ethical, and legal risks.
