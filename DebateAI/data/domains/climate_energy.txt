Climate and energy systems are complex, interconnected, and influenced by environmental, economic, and political factors.

Climate interventions often produce delayed and indirect effects that are difficult to predict accurately.

Energy transitions involve trade-offs between cost, reliability, environmental impact, and social acceptance.

Renewable energy adoption can introduce challenges related to intermittency, grid stability, and infrastructure readiness.

Climate mitigation and adaptation strategies must consider long-term sustainability rather than short-term gains.

Policy decisions in climate and energy domains frequently involve uncertainty and contested evidence.

Unintended consequences, such as resource displacement or environmental trade-offs, are common in large-scale interventions.
