Healthcare decisions directly affect patient safety, health outcomes, and quality of life.

Medical systems must prioritize accuracy, reliability, and harm minimization over efficiency alone.

Automation in healthcare introduces risks such as misdiagnosis, over-reliance on models, and reduced clinician oversight.

Clinical decision support systems are intended to assist healthcare professionals, not replace medical judgment.

Healthcare data is often incomplete, biased, or noisy, increasing uncertainty in automated decisions.

Ethical considerations include informed consent, fairness in treatment, and protection of patient privacy.

Regulatory standards emphasize validation, traceability, and accountability for medical technologies.

Errors in healthcare systems can have severe and irreversible consequences.
