Public policy decisions affect diverse populations and often involve competing stakeholder interests.

Policy outcomes depend on social, economic, and behavioral responses, not just formal rules.

Complex policies may produce unintended consequences due to feedback loops and adaptive behavior.

Evidence-based policymaking relies on empirical data, expert analysis, and ongoing evaluation.

Equity, fairness, and social impact are central considerations in public policy decisions.

Policy interventions may succeed in some contexts while failing in others due to local conditions.

Transparency and accountability improve public trust in policy decisions.
