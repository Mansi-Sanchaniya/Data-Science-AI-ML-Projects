Sound decision-making requires balancing benefits, risks, costs, and ethical considerations.

High-impact decisions should prioritize safety, reversibility, and harm minimization.
Irreversible actions warrant stricter evaluation standards.

Decisions made under uncertainty should prefer options that preserve future flexibility.
Optionality reduces long-term risk.

Risk assessment should include both probability and severity of potential outcomes.
Low-probability but high-impact risks deserve special attention.

Accountability is a critical component of responsible decision-making.
Clear responsibility for outcomes should be defined before actions are taken.

Human oversight is valuable when decisions affect people, safety, or legal responsibility.
Automation should augment judgment, not eliminate it in high-stakes contexts.

Trade-offs are unavoidable.
Effective decisions explicitly acknowledge what is being sacrificed in pursuit of benefits.

Decision quality should be evaluated independently of outcomes.
Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes, and bad decisions can sometimes appear successful.

Monitoring and feedback mechanisms improve decision quality over time.
Decisions should be revisited as new information becomes available.

When stakeholder values conflict, transparency about priorities and assumptions improves trust and legitimacy.
