Complex systems rarely behave in linear or predictable ways.
Changes to one part of a system often produce second-order and third-order effects.

Correlation does not imply causation.
Observed outcomes may be influenced by hidden variables or confounding factors.

Uncertainty is inherent in complex decision-making.
Lack of complete information should be explicitly acknowledged rather than ignored.

Expert disagreement is common, especially in emerging or rapidly evolving domains.
Disagreement does not imply incompetence, but differing assumptions, priorities, or risk tolerances.

Models and abstractions are simplifications of reality.
They can inform decisions but should not be treated as perfect representations of the real world.

Short-term benefits may conflict with long-term consequences.
Decisions should consider temporal trade-offs across multiple time horizons.

Unintended consequences are a frequent result of interventions in complex systems.
Reasoning should actively search for negative side effects, not just intended outcomes.

Confidence in conclusions should be proportional to the strength and quality of evidence.
High confidence with weak evidence increases risk.

When evidence is mixed or incomplete, conditional conclusions are often more appropriate than absolute ones.

Robust reasoning considers multiple perspectives and challenges initial assumptions before reaching conclusions.
