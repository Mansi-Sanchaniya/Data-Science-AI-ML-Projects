Facial recognition technology enables automated identification or verification of individuals based on facial features.

Potential applications include security, identity verification, and access control.

Concerns include privacy invasion, mass surveillance, and misuse by authorities or private actors.

Accuracy varies across populations, with documented disparities related to race, gender, and age.

False positives can lead to serious consequences such as wrongful identification or denial of services.

Regulatory approaches range from unrestricted deployment to partial or full bans in certain contexts.

Public trust in facial recognition systems depends on transparency, accuracy, and accountability.
