Self-driving cars use sensors, machine learning, and control systems to navigate without human drivers.

Potential benefits include reduced traffic accidents, increased mobility, and improved traffic efficiency.

Challenges include handling rare edge cases, adverse weather, and complex urban environments.

System failures can result in severe physical harm or loss of life.

Responsibility for accidents involving autonomous vehicles remains legally complex.

Gradual deployment strategies often involve mixed human and autonomous control.

Public acceptance depends on safety performance and trust in technology providers.
