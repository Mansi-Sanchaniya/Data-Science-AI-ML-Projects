Gene editing technologies enable direct modification of genetic material in living organisms.

Applications include treatment of genetic diseases, agricultural improvement, and biomedical research.

Ethical concerns arise when edits affect germline cells that can be inherited by future generations.

Risks include unintended genetic changes, long-term health effects, and unequal access to benefits.

Scientific understanding of complex genetic interactions remains incomplete.

Regulatory oversight varies significantly across countries and application areas.

Public debate often distinguishes between therapeutic uses and human enhancement.
