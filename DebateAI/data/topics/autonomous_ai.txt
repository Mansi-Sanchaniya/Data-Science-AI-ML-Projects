Autonomous AI systems are designed to perform tasks or make decisions without direct human intervention.

Potential benefits include increased efficiency, scalability, and the ability to operate in environments unsuitable for humans.

Risks include loss of human control, cascading failures, and difficulty assigning responsibility for outcomes.

Autonomous systems may behave unpredictably when operating outside their training conditions.

Human oversight mechanisms can reduce risk but may also limit autonomy benefits.

Clear boundaries between autonomous operation and human intervention are often difficult to define in practice.

Liability and accountability for autonomous decisions remain open challenges in many jurisdictions.
